# üõ°Ô∏è Coordinated Defense System: UAV Smokescreen Deployment Strategy Optimization

This project applies mathematical modeling and global optimization algorithms to determine the optimal deployment strategy for a fleet of UAVs using smokescreen rounds. The goal is to **maximize the total time** the enemy missile's line-of-sight (LOS) to the real target is obscured.

The solution progresses systematically from basic single-factor analysis to a sophisticated, high-dimensional, multi-asset coordination problem.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The core challenge is finding the optimal combination of UAV parameters‚Äîspeed, heading, release time, and fuze time‚Äîto achieve maximum cumulative obscuration time against single or multiple incoming missiles.

| Core Problem | Scenario Description | Variable Dimension | Core Solution Methodology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Problem 1-3** | Single UAV vs. Single Missile (Up to 3 Grenades) | 4D - 8D | **3D Geometric Modeling** + **Differential Evolution (DE)** |
| **Problem 4** | Three UAVs, One Grenade Each (Coordination) | 12D | **3D Geometric Modeling** + **DE** |
| **Problem 5 (Final)** | **Five UAVs, Multi-Grenade Defense vs. Three Missiles** | **30D (Time Abstraction)** | **DE** + **Interval Merging Algorithm** |

## üíª Modeling and Solution Architecture

### 1. 3D Trajectory and Obscuration Geometry (Problems 1-4)

The model precisely calculates the real-time positions of the missile, the UAV, and the smoke cloud to determine if the line of sight (LOS) is broken.

* **Smoke Grenade Trajectory**: Modeled as projectile motion under gravity ($G=9.8 \ m/s^2$).
    $$P_{blast} = P_{release} + V_{UAV} \cdot t_{fuze} + \left(0, 0, -\frac{1}{2} G \cdot t_{fuze}^2\right)$$
* **Obscuration Logic**: Obscuration occurs when the distance between the smoke cloud center ($P_{cloud}$) and the **missile's LOS segment** ($P_{missile}$ to $P_{target\_real}$) is less than the smoke radius ($R_{smoke}=10.0m$).

### 2. Global Optimization Strategy: Differential Evolution (DE)

The objective function is highly complex and non-linear. The **Differential Evolution (DE)** algorithm was chosen for its robust **global search capability**, especially effective in high-dimensional continuous spaces.

* **Objective**: $\max (\text{Total-Cover-Time})$, solved as $\min (-\text{Total-Cover-Time})$.
* **High-Performance Computing**: For high-dimensional problems, strategies like increasing iterations (`maxiter`) and using **parallel processing** (`workers=-1`) were implemented to ensure fast, high-quality convergence.

### 3. The Time Scheduling Abstraction (Problem 5)

For the final, resource-intensive scenario (**5 UAVs coordinating 15 grenades**), a simplified model was used to achieve high efficiency and optimal temporal coordination.

* **Modeling Strategy**: The 3D geometric problem is reduced to a $1D$ **interval scheduling** problem on the time axis, focusing solely on optimizing the **timing** of the 15 smoke events.
* **Core Algorithm**: The `compute_coverage` function uses a classic **Interval Merging Algorithm** to precisely calculate the length of the **union** of the 15 smoke effective time segments (each lasting $8.0s$) that overlap with the three missile time windows.

## üìä Key Results and Visualizations

### 1. Three UAVs, Coordinated Defense (Problem 4)

This solution leverages the spatial separation of the UAVs to strategically deploy countermeasures across the early, mid, and late phases of the missile flight.

| UAV | Strategy Focus | **Total Effective Coverage** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY1** | Early Phase Interception | $\approx 9.5$ s |
| **FY2** | Mid-flight Transition | $\approx 8.0$ s |
| **FY3** | Terminal Phase Interception | $\approx 7.2$ s |
| **3-UAV Coordinated** | **Total Union Coverage** | **$\approx 21.00$ s** |

#### **Visualization: 3D Coordinated Trajectories**
The 3D plot is a key deliverable, showcasing the distinct UAV flight paths, strategic detonation points, and the missile segments that were successfully obscured (highlighted in red).

### 2. Five UAVs vs. Three Missiles (Problem 5 - Final Result)

The 30-dimensional time-based optimization successfully scheduled 15 smoke grenades to achieve near-maximum coverage of the entire 30-second operational window.

| UAV | Smoke\# | t\_release (s) | t\_fuze (s) | t\_burst (s) | t\_end (s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| UAV1 | 1 | 0.05 | 0.50 | 0.55 | 8.55 |
| UAV2 | 1 | 1.10 | 1.00 | 2.10 | 10.10 |
| UAV3 | 2 | 12.00 | 1.50 | 13.50 | 21.50 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| **UAV5** | **3** | **29.00** | **0.80** | **29.80** | **37.80** |
| **Final Result** | **Total Coverage (3 missile windows)** | **$\approx 29.98$ s** |

#### **Visualization: 15-Grenade Gantt Chart**
This visualization clearly displays the precise scheduling and temporal overlaps of the 15 smoke grenades, confirming the effectiveness of the optimized deployment to achieve almost **full temporal coverage**.
